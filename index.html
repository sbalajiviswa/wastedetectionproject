        <h2>about us</h2>
        <p>
          ECOsvr bin is an iniative by students of Kumuraguru college of
          technology who belive that there is no waste and everything can be use
          full. We aim in making the most use of the so called 'WASTE' and
          thereby not only makig a profit but also contributing to our Mother
          Earth. Our current plan is to collect the waste from the most
          individual houses and commercial enterprises possible and process them
          to obtain raw materials that are useful. We are developing several
          technologies to seperate and process these waste. 
        </p>
        <p>By joining our
          membership you can contribute to our environment by doing, well,

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p> <strong>Why should we recycle? can't we throw away this waste somewhere?
          Like some empty land?</strong> There are more than ten toxic gases emitted from landfills, of which methane gas is the most serious. Methane 
          gas is naturally produced during the process of organic matter decay. On this account, EPA records that the methane expelled during the decomposition of 
          organic matter in unmanaged landfills has the potential of trapping solar radiation 20 times more effective than carbon dioxide. 
          A huge percentage of these landfill toxins infiltrate the soil to reach the fresh water waterways, which eventually end up in the domestic water and sadly enough, the foods that we consume. The pollution can also adversely harm animal and plant life. Research reveals that 82% of landfills have leaks.<br>

          <strong>
          Why not throw it in the sea? There are more space in sea anyway!</strong> Each year, as many as 30,000 northern fur seals get entangled in plastic debris and die. Marine debris can also damage boat engines by clogging intake valves and ports and becoming tangled around propellers. Although some claim the risk to human health is small, the long-term effects of nuclear dumping are not known, and some estimate up to 1,000 deaths in the next 10,000 years as a result of evaporated nuclear waste.
          The ocean is the basin that catches almost all the water in the world. Eventually, water evaporates from the ocean, leaves the salt behind, and becomes rainfall over land. Water from rain and snow ends up in rivers, which flows through estuaries and meets up with saltwater. Fertilizers, pesticides, and oil, mostly from farms, seep into the ground after a rain and then stream into rivers and ultimately into the ocean. Not only does the waste flow into the ocean, but it also encourages algal blooms to clog up the waterways, causing meadows of seagrass, kelp beds and entire ecosystems to die.
